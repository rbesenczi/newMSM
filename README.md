# newMSM - the new version of the Multimodal Surface Matching software

This is the main repository of the reimplemented MSM software. The code and licenses of the original version can be found at [this link](https://github.com/ecr05/MSM_HOCR). The user guide of that version can be found [here](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/MSM).

## Major updates

Most of the code from the original version has been replaced or revised, but some were reused. Most of the updates affect performance:
 - complete rework of the mesh resampling functionality with an octree based nearest triangle search algorithm (inspired by the wb_command of Connectome Workbench)
 - parallelisation of mesh resampling
 - application of octree search during registration
 - parallelisation of cost calculation during registration

Please note, the current version is 0.5.1-BETA. All feedbacks are much appreciated.

## Download and install
NewMSM is available to download from FSL or Github. Please follow the steps described below. (Note: tested on Ubuntu Linux and MacOS.)

### Download and install binary

1. Download and install FSL. For more information, please visit the FSL [webpage](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/).
2. Download and install newMSM from the FSL developer branch by executing the following command on Terminal:
```console
fsl/bin/conda create --override-channels -c https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/fslconda/development/ -c https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/fslconda/public/ -c conda-forge -p ./msm-env fsl-newmsm
```
3. Activate this environment:
```console
conda activate ./msm-env/
```
4. You can test with the `newmsm -p` command.

### Install from source

1. Download and install FSL. For more information, please visit the FSL [webpage](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/).
2. Create a directoy where you can download sources:
    ```console
    mkdir newmsm_sources
    cd newmsm_sources
    ```
3. Download and install newMSM sources.
    1. newMSM application and dependencies
        ```console
        git clone https://github.com/rbesenczi/newMSM.git
        cd newMSM/libraries/msm-newresampler/src/
        make && make install
        cd ../../msm-newmeshreg/src/
        make && make install
        cd ../../../src/
        make && make install
        ```
3. The binary `newmsm` should be in the folder `${FSLDEVDIR}/bin`.
4. You can test it with the `${FSLDEVDIR}/bin/newmsm -p` command.

Most features remained the same as it was in the original MSM implementation. A detailed user guide will be published soon.
